      <h1>What Volunteering means to me</h1>
      <p>
        Volunteering is something that has transformed my life.
        I was introduced to it through NHS and was quickly drawn in by the welcoming nature of the other volunteers.
        I've since volunteered at several different places and am a part of multiple volunteering groups.

        <h1>Period Club</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently the Vice President of Period Club.
          We are a feminist group with the main focus of raising money to buy menstrual products for homeless women.
          This is important because it's often an overlooked need.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have a heavy focus on de-stigmatizing periods. As a guy, I can look at this from a different angle.
          While my reaction to them was never outwardly harmful to anyone, back in Middle School I was still confused by periods.
          No one ever explained what they were for or what they were like. I can understand why some young men have the reactions
          that they do. The average response to these types of people is with blacklash, but I feel like this approach is pretty
          counterproductive. In my opinion, the best way to stop these reactions is to be open about the topic and show people
          that periods are completely normal.

        <h1>Key Club</h1>
        <p>
          Key Club is one of the most important organizations I've been a part of.
          It is a student run club with many volunteering opportunities to take part in.
          We've done everything from digging an irrigation trench at my local elementary school with Eden Acres,
          to serving pancakes to the community, to directing runners at a fundraiser race for the homeless,
          to helping out with the Annual Corn Roast in my home town.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've clocked in around 40 hours of volunteer work so far, and have been with the club since it started last year.
          I ran for both president and treasurer, but failed both times. Even though I'm not an officer, the club is still very special to me.

          What originally got me into volunteering. We needed 75 outside volunteer hours, 15 school volunteer hours,
          and to maintain a 3.5+ weighted GPA to graduate with an NHS diploma.

        <h1>Homeless Shelter</h1>
        <p>
          I first joined the winter shelter to get volunteer hours for NHS, but it soon turned into much more than that.
          For six weeks I spent a day helping prepare food for an hour and a half or so.
          We made all kinds of food and I gained a lot of teamwork skills.
