			<h2>Salutations</h2>
			<p>I'm a Junior at Seattle Pacific University studying Computer Science. My expected graduation is June 2024.</p>

			<h2>My Skills</h2>
			<div>

				<h3>Programming</h3>
				<p>
					I have been programming since my freshman year at highschool. Since then, I have become literate in C#, Java, Javascript, and C++.
					I commonly use my programming skills to make videogames in C# using unity, but have made some other stuff too.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skillRow">
				<h3>Mathematics</h3>
				<p>
					I love and enjoy math in many different aspects because it's something that really clicks with me. I'm constantly improving my skills in
					math because it often goes hand and hand with programming. Some of my favorite subsets of math include statistics and physics.
					I enjoy statistics because it opens up a new way to see the world that's often invisible to the naked eye, and I enjoy physics because
					it blends so many other subsets of math in a way that is very visible to our everyday lives!

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
				<div>
					<img src="images/heartBulb.png" alt="heart" id="hobbiesPic">
					<h3>Other Nerdy Stuff</h3>
					<p>
						Although I really love computer science, it's not my whole personality. I also am into several other things, that includes
						Dungeons and Dragons, volunteering, videogames, painting, and more!
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Why I Love What I Love</h3>
					<p>
						Almost all of my interests when it comes to my hobbies are forms of creative outlets. When I play D&D, my party and I create wacky
						stories that our characters go through. I also really enjoy graphic and UI design, making it easy for other people to consume
						information.
					</p>
					<p>
						The type of media I like to explore often contains a lot of fun and creative ideas. Some of my favorite videogames include Journey
						because of its unique take on storytelling, Noita since it has many stunning game design elements, and Hieronymus Bosch's Brutal
						Orchestra for its great character designs and music.
