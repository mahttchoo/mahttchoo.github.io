			<h2>Salutations</h2>
			<p>I'm a Senior at Forest Grove High School. I have a passion for game design, web design, and several other forms of programming.</p>

			<h2>My Skills</h2>
			<div>

				<h3>Programming</h3>
				<p>
					I have been programming since my freshman year at highschool. Since then, I have become literate in C#, Java, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.
					I commonly use my programming skills to make videogames in C# using unity, but have made some other stuff too. My videogame design
					journey first began with Javascript, although I only use it for web design now.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="skillRow">
				<h3>Mathematics</h3>
				<p>
					I love and enjoy math in many different aspects because it's something that really clicks with me. I'm constantly improving my skills in
					math because it often goes hand and hand with programming. Some of my favorite types of math are statistics and algebra.

				<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

					<h3>Other Nerdy Stuff</h3>
					<p>
						Although I really love computer science, it's not my whole personality. I also am into several other things, that includes
						Dungeons and Dragons, volunteering, videogames, design, and more!
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Why I Love What I Love</h3>
					<p>
						Almost all of my interests when it comes to my hobbies are forms of creative outlets. When I play D&D, my party and I create wacky
						stories that our characters go through. I also really enjoy designing things, and making them easy for other people to consume
						information.
					</p>
					<p>
						The type of media I like to explore often contains a lot of fun and creative ideas. Some of my favorite videogames include Journey
						because of its unique take on storytelling, Noita for its many stunning game design elements, and Minecraft since it is such an
						elegant creative sandbox.
