        <h2>Mock-Up System Proposal</h2>
        <p>
          This is a documentation writing assignment I did for my System Design class. It is based around a made up system that has no real plans
          to be made, but is written as though it would be.

          This is my most recent project, it is a simple orbital physics simulation written entirely in javascript.
          It is currently a work in progress, but is entirely functional at the moment. You're welcome to play around with it for a bit,
          I had a lot of fun making it!

      <h1>The Start of my Journey: Old Highschool Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I was first introduced into videogame design my Sophmore year with an Intro to Game Design class,
        and I've been hooked ever since. We started out by making a set of games with Javascript and then
        changing them how we wanted. I later moved onto other languages and tools.

      <div class="column">
        <h2>POOG</h2>
        <p>
          This was the very first game I ever made, just a pong clone.
          I had fun making all the little images through javascript, it taught me the basics of game code.

    <!--Breakout Game-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h2>Breakout</h2>
        <p>
          The second game I made. This time I experimented with external images instead of shapes in js.
          It was fun to experiment with a random level system that let the player try to get as far as they could.

        <h2>Racecar Game</h2>
        <p>
          The next game was a proper two player game. Two cars spawn on the canvas, and player 1 is controlled by
          the arrow keys while player 2 is controlled by wasd. This game is completely made of external images.

        <h2>Space Shooter Game</h2>
        <p>
          I made a top down arcade style shooter in Construct 2. This was pretty fun to make, I explored more in depth
          code and did something outside of javascript canvas for the first time.

          A game I made with several freinds for a videogame design competition.
          It's important to note that unlike all of the previous games on this page, this game
          wasn't entirely my own creation. The making of this videogame helped me learn
          a lot of the value in teamwork and allowed me to bond with my friends.
