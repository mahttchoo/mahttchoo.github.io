          This is a documentation writing assignment I did for my System Design class. It is based around a made up system that has no real plans
          to be made, but is written as though it would be.

          This is my most recent project, it is a simple orbital physics simulation written entirely in javascript.
          It is currently a work in progress, but is entirely functional at the moment. You're welcome to play around with it for a bit,
          I had a lot of fun making it!

          Final project for my Algorithms Design Class, written entirely in C++. Takes in a .txt that contains a list of courses,
          when they are available, their pre-requisites, and credit amount. The code organizes the classes as nodes on a graph and
          connects directed edges from pre-requisites to later classes. The code performs a DFS traversal and sorts the courseload
          in a recommended optimal order after given the maximum credit load you are willing to take per quarter. The code generates
          two bitmap (PPM) images displaying the courseflow as well as a text output.
          <br><br>
          This was a team project, half of the work was done by Mark Clemmer. I set up the visual aspect and the ordering algorithm.
          Mark set up the inputs and the graph generation. All aspects of the code have some direct influence by both of us. Many other
          parts were equally worked on.

          The Lemon Graph Library was used for this project.

          Experimental project to help me understand how graphs are used and implemented. Written in Java,
          this code allows for the user to input a .csv file containing an adjacency matrix or to generate
          each node and edge individually.
          <br><br>
          Allows for DFS, BFS, Djikstra traversals of graphs.

      <h1>The Start of my Journey: Old Highschool Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I was first introduced into videogame design my Sophmore year with an Intro to Game Design class,
        and I've been hooked ever since. We started out by making a set of games with Javascript and then
        changing them how we wanted. I later moved onto other languages and tools.

        <p>
          This was the very first game I ever made, just a pong clone.
          I had fun making all the little images through javascript, it taught me the basics of game code.

          <h2>Breakout</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          The second game I made. This time I experimented with external images instead of shapes in js.
          It was fun to experiment with a random level system that let the player try to get as far as they could.

          The next game was a proper two player game. Two cars spawn on the canvas, and player 1 is controlled by
          the arrow keys while player 2 is controlled by wasd. This game is completely made of external images.

          I made a top down arcade style shooter in Construct 2. This was pretty fun to make, I explored more in depth
          code and did something outside of javascript canvas for the first time.

          A game I made with several freinds for a videogame design competition.
          It's important to note that unlike all of the previous games on this page, this game
          wasn't entirely my own creation. The making of this videogame helped me learn
          a lot of the value in teamwork and allowed me to bond with my friends.
